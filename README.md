*Filling out your PCO Advance on Travel Expense forms since 2018*

[PCO](https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council.html) doesn't support electronic forms or online submissions - so let's make a computer fill out the form instead of doing it by hand, and then email it to someone who can print it and cover the last mile.

# Deployment
Developed on [Apex UP](https://github.com/apex/up), because `#serverless`.

Get that working locally, fix `up.json` to use the right domains, and then `$ up`.
